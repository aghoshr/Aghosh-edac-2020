            Rishi Raj Kapoor was born on 4 September 
            1952 at his family's home in Matunga, Bombay, in the then Bombay State of India,
            into a Khatri Punjabi Hindu family.He attended Campion School, Mumbai and Mayo College, Ajmer.
            Being part of the Kapoor dynasty, he was the second son of legendary actor-director Raj Kapoor and 
            Krishna Raj Kapoor (née Malhotra).Likewise, his family encompasses a successful line of actors,
            including brothers, Randhir and Rajiv Kapoor; grandfather Prithviraj Kapoor; maternal uncles Prem, 
            Rajendra, and Narendra Nath, as well as Prem Chopra; paternal uncles Shashi Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor; 
            and paternal once removed cousins Anil Kapoor and Sanjay Kapoor.Rishi Kapoor's two sisters, on the
            other hand, include late Ritu Nanda, who was an insurance agent, and Rima Jain. The actresses Karisma

             <br>
             Around the age of three, Kapoor's first on-screen appearance was a cameo in his father Raj Kapoor's
             film Shree 420 (1955), where he would appear in the musical sequence of "Pyar Hua, Iqrar Hua Hai".
             Likewise, Raj Kapoor would direct the film that provided Rishi his debut role, the 1970 film Mera Naam 
             Joker, in which the actor would portray the young version of the lead character (played by Raj Kapoor).
             Rishi Kapoor's first leading role would come in adulthood, opposite Dimple Kapadia, in the 1973 film Bobby,
             also directed by his father.Bobby went on to become one of the decade's biggest hits in India, and
             earned Rishi Kapoor the Filmfare Best Actor Award.Regarding the film, he would say in a 2012 interview:
             "There was a misconception that the film was made to launch me as an actor. The film was actually made
             to pay the debts of Mera Naam Joker. Dad wanted to make a teenage love story and he did not have money to 
             cast Rajesh Khanna in the film". Following Bobby (1973), he starred in several light-hearted comedies within 
             that decade, including, among others: Rafoo Chakkar (1975), with Neetu Singh; Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), with
             Amitabh Bachchan; and Khel Khel Mein (1975) and Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977) with Zeenat Aman
